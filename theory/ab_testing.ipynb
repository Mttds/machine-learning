    "Suppose you have a website that provides machine learning content in a blog-like format. Recently you saw an article claiming that similar websites could improve their engagement by simply using a specific color palette for the background. Since this change seems pretty easy to implement you decide to run an AB test to see if this change does in fact drive your users to stay more time in your website.\n",

    "The metric you decide to evaluate is the `average session duration`, which measures how much time on average your users are spending on your website. This metric currently has a value of 30.87 minutes.\n",
